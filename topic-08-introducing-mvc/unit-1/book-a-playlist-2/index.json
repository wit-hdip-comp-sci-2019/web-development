If this works correctly, you should see the playlist in the dashboard just by restarting the application.\n\n## Exercise 3: Admin Panel\n\nThis is a challenging exercise - but the hints provide most of what you need.\n\nProblem: We would like an 'admin' interface to the application, which displays all the songs in the database - ignoring the playlists they belong to for the moment. The view should also display the IDs of the songs:\n\n![](img/09.png)\n\nThis is a 'hidden' view, that does not appear in the menu. It is accessed by browsing directly to:\n\n- <http://localhost:9000/admin>\n\n##Hints:\n\nYou will need a new route:\n\n~~~\nGET     /admin                                  Admin.index\n~~~\n\n... and a matching controller + view:\n\n## Admin Controller\n\n~~~\npackage controllers;\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\nimport models.Playlist;\nimport models.Song;\nimport play.Logger;\nimport play.mvc.Controller;\n\npublic class Admin extends Controller\n{\n  public static void index() \n  {\n    Logger.info(\"Rendering Admin\");\n\n    // TODO - get list of all songs, and send them to the view\n    render (\"admin.html\");\n  }\n}\n\n~~~\n\n\n## Admin view\n\n~~~\n#{extends 'main.html' /}\n#{set title:'Dashboard' /}\n\n#{menu id:\"admin\"/}\n\n  <section class=\"ui segment\">\n  <h2 class=\"ui header\">\n    All Known Songs in the Database:\n  </h2>\n  <table class=\"ui fixed table\">\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th>ID </th>\n        <th>Song</th>\n        <th>Artist</th>\n        <th>Duration</th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n\n      // TODO Iterate through a list of songs and populate rows in the table.\n\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</section>\n~~~\n\n## Even more Hints!\n\nHow to read all songs form the Songs table:\n\n~~~\n    List<Song> songs = Song.findAll();\n~~~\n\nHow to iterate through a list of songs:\n\n~~~\n       ...\n      #{list items:songs, as:'song'}\n         ...\n         ...\n      #{/list}\n       ...\n~~~\n\nHow to get the songs from the controller to the view:\n\n~~~\n...\n  render(\"admin.html\", songs);\n...\n~~~\n\nThe solution to this exercise is provided in the next lab - but try to have a go first before working through the solution.\n"
