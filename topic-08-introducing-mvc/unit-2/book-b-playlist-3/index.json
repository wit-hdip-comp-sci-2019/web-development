    "contentMd" : "# Deleting Songs 1\n\nHaving a playlist app, without the ability to create/delete songs or playlists is clearly very limited. We have, essentially, an app that allows us to `Read` our models, but not `Create`, `Update` or `Delete` elements of the model.\n\nWe can start with providing a facility to delete songs from individual playlists. Our view will need to look like this:\n\n![](img/05.png)\n\nand pressing the delete button should remove the corresponding song.\n\nAny new button/link/action on our page requires:\n\n- an new button element in the view for each song\n- a route matching the new button element\n- a matching controller method\n\n.. and it may also involve some interaction with the model.\n\n# View\n\nThe new button must appear in each song row. Here is a revised listsongs partial:\n\n## app/views/tags/listsongs.html\n\n~~~html\n<table class=\"ui fixed table\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Song</th>\n      <th>Artist</th>\n      <th>Duration</th>\n      <th></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    #{list items:_playlist.songs, as:'song'}\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          ${song.title}\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          ${song.artist}\n        </td>\n        <td>        \n          ${song.duration}\n        </td>      \n         <td>\n            <a href=\"/playlists/${_playlist.id}/deletesong/${song.id}\" class=\"ui tiny red button\">Delete Song</a>\n         </td>         \n      </tr>\n    #{/list}\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n~~~\n\nLook at the new element\n\n~~~\n         <td>\n            <a href=\"/playlists/${_playlist.id}/deletesong/${song.id}\" class=\"ui tiny red button\">Delete Song</a>\n         </td>         \n~~~\n\nIt is just an `<a>` element - styled to look like a button. The `href` is manufactured to include the ids of both the playlist + the song. So it might be:\n\n~~~\n... href=\"/playlists/123/deletesong/321\" ...\n~~~  \n\n... where 123 is the id of the playlist, and 321 is the id of the song.\n\n# Route\n\nWe now need a new route - containing both the playlist and song id - and linking to a new method in the playlist controller:\n\n## conf/routes\n\n~~~js\nGET     /playlists/{id}/deletesong/{songid}     PlaylistCtrl.deleteSong\n~~~\n\n# Controller\n\nThis is the new method to handle this route:\n\n## app/ontrollers/PlaylistCtrl.java\n\n~~~js\n...\n  public static void deletesong (Long id, Long songid)\n  {\n    Playlist playlist = Playlist.findById(id);\n    Song song = Song.findById(songid);\n    Logger.info (\"Removing\" + song.title);\n\n    render(\"playlist.html\", playlist);\n  }\n...\n~~~\n\nTry all of this now - and verify that the logs shows the attempt to delete the song when the button is pressed.\n\nWe havent yet deleted the song - we will leave that to the next step.\n\nTo summarise, for every song we are generating a `delete` button. This button's href contains the id of the playlist + the song we want to delete. When the user presses this button, it triggers a call to our new Controller method. This method is then able to locate the playlist/song in the database using the IDs from the route.\n\n"
