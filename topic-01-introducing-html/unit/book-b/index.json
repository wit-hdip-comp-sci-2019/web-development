    "contentMd" : "# Project Setup\n\nConsider creating a folder structure for your labs - starting with a folder called `web-development`. \n\nYou can do this any number of ways - but the simplest might be using File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac). This can be located anywhere convenient - but make sure you know where it is on the file system. One useful location is `C:` on Windows. On Mac, your home folder. Alternatively, you might create the folder on the desktop - however this is perhaps not the best longer term location.\n\nStudents sometimes create folders like this on a folder located in Dropbox - this has the advantage that it will be continually backed up in case of an issue later.\n\nWherever you choose - launch Sublime Text to start the lab:\n\n![](img/01x.png)\n\nOpen Sublime and choose `Open Folder` from the File menu, navigate to the `web-development` folder you have just created and click `Open Folder`.\n\n![](img/02x.png)\n\nIn sublime click on the `web-development` folder, right click - and select `New Folder`. Enter the folder name `lab-01` (this appears at the foot of the sublime menu as shown below)\n\n![](img/03x.png)\n\nPress return, and the sidebar should reveal the new folder you have created:\n\n![](img/04x.png)\n\nNow, select the `lab-01` folder - and select Right-Click on the mouse. This brings up a Context menu:\n\n![](img/12x.png)\n\nSelect New File - and this will create a new file:\n\n![](img/05x.png)\n\nNotice that the title in the file is 'untitled'. Select `Save` on the File menu and name the file `index.html`. This may bring up a dialog to help you locate and name the file.\n\n![](img/06x.png)\n\nGive the file the name index.html.\n\nMake sure the file is saved into the `web-development/lab-01` folder as shown above (this should be the default).\n\nOnce the file is saved, then Sublime should look like this:\n\n![](img/07x.png)\n\nLook carefully at the side bar - and make sure yours looks identical.\n\nNow, copy paste the text below into the index.html file:\n\n~~~\nWelcome to the App Bundle Store\n~~~\n\n![](img/08x.png)\n\nNow, using the File Explorer (or Finder on mac), browse to the project and its contents:\n\n![](img/09x.png)\n\nDepending on which is your default browser - opening this file (by double clicking) will let you view the file in that browser:\n\n![](img/10x.png)\n\n\nNote, you do not need to create files/folders from within Sublime, you can do the same using File Explorer/Finder.\n\nOne final point - make sure the, in File Explorer, the full name is visible (including the .html component). If this is not, then locate the \"File name extension\" setting in File Explorer:\n\n![](img/14x.png)\n\n... and make sure it is selected (as shown).\n\n\n\nThat is a lot of steps! However, once you get used to manipulating files/folders this will become easier. If this type of interaction is new to you, perhaps consider deleting everything you have created so far, and redo it again to gain some practice time.\n\n\n"

    "contentMd" : "## Downloading Images\n\nUsing techniques from the previous step, create a new folder inside the lab-01 folder in your project called \"images\". Sublime might look like this:\n\n![](img/17x.png)\n\nAll you need to do is right-click on the \"lab-01\" folder in sublime, and select \"New Folder\" from the context menu - name the folder \"images\"\n\n![](img/18x.png)\n\n\n# Image Library\n\nBelow are two images:\n\n![](./img/ondesoft.jpg)\n\n![](./img/banner.png)\n\nRight click on each one of these now (in the browser you are reading this on) and select \"Save Image As\". \n\n![](img/22x.png)\n\nIt brings up a dialog inviting you to locate the folder, and name the file, you are about to save. \n\nYour task now is to locate the \"web-development/lab-01/images\" folder you have just created, and save the files in there. The files will have a default name, which you can keep.\n\nIf all of the above goes as expected, you your sublime window should look like this:\n\n![](./img/20x.png)\n\nThe logical structure of your project is something like this now:\n\n~~~\nweb-development\n     └── lab-01\n        ├── images\n        │   ├── banner.png\n        │   └── ondesoft.jpg\n        └── index.html\n\n~~~\n\nSee if you can verify that this is the structure visually using File Explorer / Finder."

This can be hard to see exactly in sublime - so consult Explore/Finder to make sure it is in the correct location.\n\nWe bind this file into the project by 'linking' it to our home page. This must be incorporated into the `<head`> element of each page. Currently index.html head section looks like this:\n\n~~~html\n  <head>\n    <title>Bundle APP Store</title>\n  </head>\n~~~\n\nWe can extend it with a new element to link to the stylesheet. The head section of the index.html home page should now look like this:\n\n~~~html\n  <head>\n    <title>Bundle APP Store</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n  </head>\n~~~\n\nSave your files and open the index.html page in your browser and keep this window open. There is no visible effect on our page yet until we introduce a rule into the stylesheet. \n\nType all of the following into the style.css file (note the American spelling of the word color) :\n\n\n~~~css\nh1 {\n  color: red;\n}\n~~~\n\nSave all your files. Refresh the index page in your browser and see the result of writing this one css rule.\n\n![](./img/27x.png)\n\nThe header is now red.\n\nRemove the css rule you have just introduced and replace it with this one:\n\n~~~css\nbody {\n  font-family:sans-serif;\n}\n~~~\n\nRefresh the browser view - and verify visually that the font has changed. If you are finding it hard to spot, remove the rule again - save and refresh - until you can see the difference.\n\n\nNow append these rules - and review the effect on the rendered pages:\n\n~~~css\nh1, h2\n{\n  color: gray\n}\n\nh1 {\n  border-bottom: 1px solid black;\n}\n~~~\n\nYour css file now looks like this:\n\n~~~\nbody {\n  font-family: sans-serif;\n}\n\nh1, h2 {\n  color: gray\n}\n\nh1 {\n  border-bottom: 1px solid black;\n}\n~~~\n\n\n"

You may not have time to complete them all. They are indented to promote some experimentation on your part, and need not be submitted to the course web. If you have having issues - post on the slack \"web-development\" channel, or contact your tutors directly via Slack Direct Messaging.\n\n\n## Exercise 1: Zip Archive\n\nDownload the \"Source Code\" from the above link. This is a zipped archive of the completed lab. See if you can uncompress (unzip) the archive. This can usually be accomplished just be double clicking it. The unzipped archive will be contained in a folder called \"bundle-store\". Now, relocate (drag/drop perhaps) this unzipped archive to somewhere else on your workstation. Perhaps consider creating a new folder called \"solutions\" inside the \"web-development\" folder, and place the solution in there.\n\nOpen the solution project, both in Sublime and a browser.\n\n## Exercise 2: Index.html\n\nJust to get used to the editor, create a few more new apps in the 'apps.html', perhaps you can locate content from some web source (including images). For instance here:\n\n- <https://mac-bundles.com>\n\nTry to identify and replicate the way the code is indented in the existing content.\n\n## Exercise 3: New pages\n\nIncorporate content into a new `directions.html` page. It can contain any content you think would be useful. Incorporate a link from index to this page.\n\n\n## Exercise 4: Link the CSS file to all pages\n\nCurrently you may not have the CSS file 'linked' to app.html or the `directions.html` page. i.e. only index.html is styled with the css rules you have defined. See if you can link the other pages now.\n\n\n## Exercise 4: HTML Reference\n\nIf you are finding initial contact with HTML a little challenging - this is an excellent starter resource to review:\n\n - <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics>\n\nIt is short read.\n\n## Exercise 5: Lists\n\nIn this lab you used the element `<ul>` in the index page.\n\nInvestigate the use of `<ol>` , find out the differences between these elements here:\n\n - <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Styling_lists>\n\n"
