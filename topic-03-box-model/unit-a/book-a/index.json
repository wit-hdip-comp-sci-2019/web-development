First, one more adjustment.

Reload the page and see what effect it has.\n\n![](img/33x.png)\n\nNot quite what we were looking for - out grid children went directly into the 10% and 60% columns.\n\nHere are new rules to fix this:\n\n~~~\n#maincontent {\n  grid-column-start: 2;\n}\n\n#sidebar {\n  grid-column-start: 3;\n}\n~~~\n\nThese rules define in which column (of four) the child is to be displayed.

Also notice, we have had to 'make room' for this in the columns so that the four columns (total 85%) + the three gaps (15%) adds up to 100%.\n\nThe page now looks like this:\n\n![](img/35x.png)\n\nStill not quite finished - but almost there.\n"},{"title":"#Exercise","shortTitle":"Exercises","contentMd":"#Exercise\n\nThis is the final version of the project at this stage:\n\n- <https://github.com/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2019/bundle-store/releases/tag/lab.03.end>\n\n## Exercise\n\nHave a look at this screen shot here:\n\n![](img/36.png)\n\nNotice two aspects:\n\n- The sidebar images are resized to a uniform dimension\n- The banner image is centered\n\nTry to make these changes.
