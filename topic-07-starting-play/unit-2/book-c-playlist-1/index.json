Open a shell and enter the following:\n\n~~~bash\ngit clone https://github.com/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2019/play-template-1\n~~~\n\nThe shell should show something like this:\n\n~~~bash\nCloning into 'play-template-1'...\nremote: Counting objects: 66, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (47/47), done.\nremote: Total 66 (delta 9), reused 66 (delta 9), pack-reused 0\nUnpacking objects: 100% (66/66), done.\n~~~\n\n## Rename Project\n\nThe default name of the project should be changed now. This will require the following procedure:\n\n- Rename the folder `play-template-1`. Call the folder `playlist` instead.\n- Use Sublime Text to edit the file: `playlist/conf/application.conf`. The first three lines contains the following:\n\n    ~~~bash\n    # This is the main configuration file for the application.\n    # ~~\n    application.name=play-template-1\n    ~~~\n\n- Change `play-template-1` above to `playlist`, and save the file:\n\n    ~~~bash\n    # This is the main configuration file for the application.\n    # ~~\n    application.name=playlist\n    ~~~\n\n## Import into Idea\n\nStill in the shell, and in the project folder enter the following command:\n\n~~~\nplay idealize\n~~~\n\nYou should get this response:\n\n~~~\n~        _            _\n~  _ __ | | __ _ _  _| |\n~ | '_ \\| |/ _' | || |_|\n~ |  __/|_|\\____|\\__ (_)\n~ |_|            |__/\n~\n~ play! 1.5.2, https://www.playframework.com\n~\n~ OK, the application is ready for Intellij Idea\n~ Use File, Open Project... to open \"playlist.ipr\"\n~\n~~~\n\nNow we can import the project into Idea. Launch Idea, and select `File->Open`. Select the Directory containing the project you have just created (play-template-1)\n\n![](img/17.png)\n\n(Again - you may need to press the button on the extreme bottom left to get the view shown above)\n\nExplore the `controllers` and `views` folders - examining each file.\n"

    {
    "title": "# Static Playlist",
    "shortTitle": "04",
    "contentMd" : "# Static Playlist\n\nIn this step we will start to display the playlist itself. First, introduce new partial called `listsongs.html`:\n\n## views/tags/listsongs.html\n\n~~~html\n<table class=\"ui fixed table\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Song</th>\n      <th>Artist</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n      </td>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n~~~\n\nNow change the dashboard view to invoke this partial:\n\n## views/dashboard.html\n\n~~~html\n#{extends 'main.html' /}\n#{set title:'Dashboard' /}\n\n#{menu id:\"dashboard\"/}\n\n<section class=\"ui segment\">\n  <h2 class=\"ui header\">\n    Playlist Title\n  </h2>\n  #{listsongs/}\n</section>\n~~~\n\nMake sure the app runs successfully. The table will be empty.\n\nTo test out the UX, we might include some actual songs (replace the `<tbody>` of listsongs with the following):\n\n## views/tags/listsongs.html\n\n~~~html\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      Piano Sonata No. 3\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      Beethoven\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      Piano Sonata No. 7\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      Beethoven\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      Piano Sonata No. 10\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      Beethoven\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n~~~\n\n... and also give the playlist a title in dashboard:\n\n## views/dashboard.html\n\n~~~html\n....\n  <h2 class=\"ui header\">\n    Beethoven Sonatas\n  </h2>\n...\n~~~\n\nExercise the UX fully again. Make sure the playlist above is being displayed. \n\nKeep an eye on the shell (console) used to launch the app:\n\n![](img/12.png)\n\nLocate where in the controllers these messages are being generated:\n\n~~~js\n...\n    Logger.info(\"Rendering Dashboard\");\n...\n~~~\n\nThese logging messages are a useful technique for figuring out what might be going wrong with an app. There are three variants of the logging statement: `info`, `error` and `debug`. Experiment now with some of these, and exercise the app to make sure the log messages appear.\n\n~~~js\n...\n    Logger.Error(\"some error has occurred\");\n...\n~~~\n\n~~~js\n...\n    Logger.debug(\"some step has occurred...\");\n...\n~~~\n\nIntroduce some of the above log statements, and verify that they appear as expected on the console.\n"

    "title": "# Playlist Model",
    "shortTitle": "05",
    "contentMd" : "# Playlist Model\n\nThe app as we have it now could have been completely built as a static web site. However, the framework and tools we have used in this version enable us to evolve this static site into an interactive app\n\n## Model Classes\n\nWe can introduce 'model' classes to implement the playlist in our app. Introduce these two new classes into the `models` package:\n\n## app/models/Song.java\n\n~~~\npackage models;\n\npublic class Song\n{\n  public String title;\n  public String artist;\n  \n  public Song(String title, String artist)\n  {\n    this.title = title;\n    this.artist = artist;\n  }\n}\n~~~\n\n## app/models/Playlist.java \n\n~~~\npackage models;\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class Playlist\n{\n  public String title;\n  public List<Song> songs = new ArrayList<Song>();\n\n  public Playlist(String title)\n  {\n    this.title = title;\n  }\n}\n~~~\n\n## Controller\n\nIn the Dashboard controller, we can define a playlist object in Java, add some songs, and send to the view:\n\n~~~js\npackage controllers;\n\nimport models.Playlist;\nimport models.Song;\nimport play.Logger;\nimport play.mvc.Controller;\n\npublic class Dashboard extends Controller\n{\n  public static void index() {\n    Logger.info(\"Rendering Dashboard\");\n    \n    Song s1 = new Song(\"Piano Sonata No. 3\", \"Beethoven\");\n    Song s2 = new Song(\"Piano Sonata No. 7\", \"Beethoven\");\n    Song s3 = new Song(\"Piano Sonata No. 10\", \"Beethoven\");\n    Playlist playlist = new Playlist(\"Beethoven Sonatas\");\n    playlist.songs.add (s1);\n    playlist.songs.add (s2);\n    playlist.songs.add (s3);\n    \n    render (\"dashboard.html\", playlist);\n  }\n}\n~~~\n\n## Views\n\nThe next step is to eliminate some of the static content from the listsongs partial. Here is a new version to replace the current version:\n\n## views/tags/listsongs.html\n\n~~~html\n<table class=\"ui fixed table\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Song</th>\n      <th>Artist</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    #{list items:_playlist.songs, as:'song'}\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          ${song.title}\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          ${song.artist}\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    #{/list}\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n~~~\n\nIn the above, we are `iterating` over an `array` of `songs` inside a `playlist` object\n\nHere is a new version of the dashboard, which will have to pass the playlist to the partial :\n\n## app/views/dashboard.html\n\n~~~\n#{extends 'main.html' /}\n#{set title:'Dashboard' /}\n\n#{menu id:\"dashboard\"/}\n\n<section class=\"ui segment\">\n  <h2 class=\"ui header\">\n    Beethoven Sonatas\n  </h2>\n  #{listsongs playlist:playlist/}\n</section>\n~~~\n\nThis playlist object, in turn, must be passed to the dashboard controller for this to work. We already did this in the Dashboard conntroller.\n\nRun the app now - and verify that you can see the playlists.\n"

Each of these contains 3 songs. Read this code carefully and make sure you can understand the data structure.\n\nHere is a new version of the dashboard view:\n\n## app/views/dashboard.html\n\n~~~\n#{extends 'main.html' /}\n#{set title:'Dashboard' /}\n\n#{menu id:\"dashboard\"/}\n\n#{list items:playlists, as:'playlist'}\n  <section class=\"ui segment\">\n    <h2 class=\"ui header\">\n      ${playlist.title}\n    </h2>\n    #{listsongs playlist:playlist/}\n  </section>\n#{/list}\n~~~\n\nBrowse the dashboard app now - and you should see the two views:\n\n![](img/13.png)\n\nSee if you can follow the logic from the controller to the view:\n\n~~~\n...\n    render (\"dashboard.html\", playlists);\n...\n~~~\n\nThen in the view - a loop iterating over the playlists \n\n~~~\n#{list items:playlists, as:'playlist'}\n  ...\n  ...\n#{/list}\n~~~\n\n... and finally in `listsongs.html`, iterating over each song in a single playlist:\n\n~~~\n    ...\n    #{list items:_playlist.songs, as:'song'}\n      ...\n      ...\n    #{/list}\n    ...\n~~~\n\nThis is a complex flow from java into one template... then into another.\n\n"

Then, from a shell inside the folder enter:\n\n~~~\nplay idealize\n~~~\n\n... and then open the project. Run the project (using `play run` from the command line) and examine the running program by browsing to:\n\n- <http://localhost:9000>\n\n## Exercise 2: Review Playlist Data Structure\n\nLook again at the playlist as represented in:\n\n~~~\n    Song s1 = new Song(\"Piano Sonata No. 3\", \"Beethoven\");\n    Song s2 = new Song(\"Piano Sonata No. 7\", \"Beethoven\");\n    Song s3 = new Song(\"Piano Sonata No. 10\", \"Beethoven\");\n    Playlist p1 = new Playlist(\"Beethoven Sonatas\");\n    p1.songs.add (s1);\n    p1.songs.add (s2);\n    p1.songs.add (s3);\n    \n    Song s4 = new Song(\"Piano Concerto No. 1\", \"Beethoven\");\n    Song s5 = new Song(\"Piano Concerto No. 12\", \"Beethoven\");\n    Song s6 = new Song(\"Piano Concerto No. 23\", \"Beethoven\");\n    Playlist p2 = new Playlist(\"Beethoven Concertos\");\n    p2.songs.add (s4);\n    p2.songs.add (s5);\n    p2.songs.add (s6);\n    \n    List<Playlist> playlists = new ArrayList<Playlist>();\n    playlists.add(p1);\n    playlists.add(p2);\n~~~\n\nReview the structure carefully. Can you draw a picture of the structure of the data? Extend your version of the app to contain a new playlist - make up some songs. Verify that they are rendered as expected.\n\n## Exercise 3: New Fields\n\nExtend the song model to also have a `duration` field. Change the constructor to initialise this field. Modify the dashboard view to display it. Also include a duration field in the Playlist.\n\n## Exercise 4: Extend Views\n\nExtend the following views:\n\n- Start: Extend the start view to contain a more detailed outline of the purpose of the application\n- About: Extend the about view to provide contact details (may be fictitious) for the author/company that created the app.\n"
