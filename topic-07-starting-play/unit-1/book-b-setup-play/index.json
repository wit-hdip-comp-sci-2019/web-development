Your system will most likely look a little different from the one shown below:\n\n![](img/21.png)\n\nWith this view open, press `New` - add a new entry to this list:\n\n![](img/22.png)\n\nThis new entry should be the path where play is installed. This could be `C:\\dev\\play-1.5.2` as in the above example.\n\nNB: DO NOT DELETE ANY OF THE CURRENT VALUES OF THE PATH!\n\nPress \"Ok\" all the way back and rerun the command prompt (close the one already open).\n\nTo test, just type \"play\" from a command prompt you should see something like this:\n\n~~~\n~        _            _\n~  _ __ | | __ _ _  _| |\n~ | '_ \\| |/ _' | || |_|\n~ |  __/|_|\\____|\\__ (_)\n~ |_|            |__/\n~\n~ play! 1.5.2, http://www.playframework.org\n~\n~ Usage: play cmd [app_path] [--options]\n~\n~ with,  new      Create a new application\n~        run      Run the application in the current shell\n~        help     Show play help\n~~~\n\nOr, if you did not manage to get the play folder on the path, then this command here should work (if you used the recommended folder structure)\n\n~~~\nC:\\dev\\play1-1.5.2\\play\n~~~\n\nHowever, it is best to ensure that the play command is on the system path.\n\n"

For example - before revealing hidden files:\n\n![](img/01x.png)\n\n... and after revealing hidden files:\n\n![](img/02x.png)\n\nHidden files are displayed in a greyed out font shown above.\n\nOne of the revealed files will be may be:\n\n- `.bash_profile`\n\nIf the file does not exist, the create it.\n\nNow edit this file, and append the new folder (containing the expanded play archive) onto the end if the PATH sequence:\n\n~~~\nPATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$HOME/dev/play-1.5.2\nexport PATH\n~~~\n\n\nIf you do not have any .bash_profile file, then you can create one to look like the extract above.\n\nAll of the above assumes you extracted the play archive into the dev folder in your home folder."
