Also notice that we rename the files we create to 'file-1.html' and 'file-2.html' form the default name windows suggests.\n\nSee if you can replicate the above precisely.\n\n## Editing in Sublime\n\nWith this folder structure created, we an open Sublime\n\n![](img/06x.png)\n\nThen we open the `web` folder so that the folder + subfolders and files are visible from a side bar in Sublime:\n\n![](img/07x.png)\n\nThere are a number of ways of enabling this view. One way is to `drag and drop` the web folder onto the sublime canvas. The sidebar may appear immediately - or you may need to specifically show it via the `view->sidebar` menu option.\n\nYou should now be able to select and edit any file in the folders. Try it now and verify that you can enter some random text, save the files, close and reopen sublime to verify that the contents have been retained.\n\nIt is important to regularly save your work. In sublime if you go to close your files it will prompt you to see if you want to save your work (if it has changed). However better practice to regularly save as you work."

The brief for the project has been sketched on a napkin!\n\n![](./img/10.png)\n\nThese are the steps you should carry out:\n\n\n- Create a folder for the project called `starbuzz`\n- Inside the folder, create a file called `index.html`\n\nHere is how Sublime might look if you do the above:\n\n![](./img/09x.png)\n\n\nNow we enter the following contents into the (blank) index.html file:\n\n~~~\nStarbuzz Coffee Beverages\n\nHouse Blend, $1.49\nA smooth, mild blend of coffees from Mexico, Bolivia and Guatemala.\n\nMocha Cafe Latte, $2.35\nEspresso, steamed mild and chocolate syrup.\n\nCappuccino, $1.89\nA mixture of espresso, steamed milk and foam.\n\nChai Tea, $1.85\nA spicy drink made with black tea, spices, milk and honey.\n\n~~~\n\nYou can copy/paste the above text - no need to enter it manually. Your editor may look like this:\n\n![](./img/10x.png)\n\n\nNow, we would like to view the file we have just saved using a web browser (Chrome in this case). This can normally be done just by double clicking on the file in Explorer:\n\n![](./img/11x.png)\n\nThis is a web rendering of the file we created. It doesnt look very pretty -  we will improve it in the next step...\n\n"

    "contentMd" : "# First HTML Tags\n\nHTML gives you a way to tell the browser about the structure of your page. What's structure? It is a way of marking up your text so that the browser knows what's a heading, what text is a paragraph, what text is a subheading and so on. Once the browser knows a little about the structure, it can display your page in a more meaningful and readable manner.\n\nYou could imagine the tags as Fridge Magnets - we are going to use the decorate the page we created:\n\n![](./img/18.png)\n\nThe tags shown in the image above are used to place structure to the content we typed. So we want to identify which content is a heading, which is a subheading and which is a paragraph.\n\nIf we first identify the heading, it is clearly the first line in our content : `Starbuzz Coffee Beverages`. Next a paragraph could be `A smooth, mild blend of coffees from Mexico, Bolivia and Guatemala.`\n\n![](./img/19.png)\n\nUsing the tags we surround each piece of content as suggested above, This is what the page should look like in Sublime:\n\n![](./img/xx1.png)\n\nSave your work, and now open/refresh our web page in the web browser:\n\n![](./img/xx2.png)\n\nCompare this with the way the browser displayed the file in the last step:\n\n![](./img/11x.png)\n"
