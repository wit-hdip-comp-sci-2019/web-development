This project is an evolution of lab-01 as completed last week, but augmented with a small number of additions prompted by the exercises.\n\nTo download the project, visit the above page and select the source code (zip) link:\n\n![](img/01x.png)\n\nIf using chrome, you will see an indication along the base of the window if the file downloaded:\n\n![](img/02x.png)\n\nSelecting \"Show All\" will give you a more detailed view:\n\n![](img/03x.png)\n\nThen select \"Show in Folder\"\n\n![](img/04x.png)\n\nNow select the archive itself - and Right Click:\n\n![](img/05x.png)\n\nSelect \"Extract All as shown above.\n\nWindows will then present a choice of locations to extract the archive.\n\n![](img/06x.png)\n\nBy pressing 'Browse', navigate to where you may have been working in last weeks lab - in this example C:/web-development:\n\n![](img/07x.png)\n\nNow proceed to extract the file here:\n\n![](img/08x.png)\n\nThe folder structure may resemble this once the extraction has completed:\n\n![](img/09x.png)\n\nFinally, rename the folder from \"bundle-store-lab.01.exercises\" to simply \"lab-01\"\n\n![](img/10x.png)\n\nSwitching to Sublime now, open the Web Development folder, and both projects (lab-01 and lab-02) should be visible:\n\n![](img/11x.png)\n\nOpen and explore the lab-02 project in a browser. It is similar to lab-01, with a small number of extra features (inspired by the exercises from last week)."},{"title":"#CSS Rules","shortTitle":"02","contentMd":"#CSS Rules\n\nCurrently our CSS file looks like this:\n\n~~~css\nbody {\n  font-family: sans-serif;\n}\n\nh1, h2 {\n  color: gray\n}\n\nh1 {\n  border-bottom: 1px solid black;\n}\n~~~\n\nWhich produces the following style for the index page:\n\n![](./img/11x.png)\n\n\nAdd the following element around the text \"great prices\" in the main paragraph of the index.html page:\n\n~~~html\n      <em>great app bundles</em>\n~~~\n\nThis uses the `<em>` element, which introduces an emphasis style:\n\n- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em>\n\nYou may be able to see that this text is in italics.\n\nWe can introduce the following rule into our stylesheet to target this specific element:\n\n~~~css\nem {\n  color:red;\n}\n~~~\n\nSave the stylesheet and refresh the page in the browser. The text 'great app bundles<' should be in italics and the colour red.\n\nWhen experimenting with CSS, we often want to experiment with the effects we are introducing. Specifically, introducing some rules, and then perhaps removing them again to see the difference (if any).\n\nTake the body rule in your stylesheet and 'comment out' the font rule:\n\n~~~css\nbody {\n  /*font-family:sans-serif;*/\n}\n~~~\n\nSave and reload. You should be able to notice the difference. This is called 'commenting' and is a common technique in both programming and web development. \n\n'Uncomment' the rule again (remove the `/*` and `*/` symbols).\n"},{"title":"#Colours","shortTitle":"03","contentMd":"#Colours\n\nWeb colours are specified in terms of how much red, green, and blue make up the colour. You specify the amount of each colour from 0 to 100% and then add them all together to arrive at a final colour.\n\nYou can use the names of colours, but CSS defines the names of only 17 colours. That number limits the expressiveness of your pages. By specifying colours in red, green and blue, you can have access to sixteen million colours.\n\n## Specifying Colour using colour names\n\nThe most straightforward way to describe a colour in CSS is just to use its name. For example to specify \"silver\" as the background colour of a body element:\n\n~~~css\nbody {\n  background-color: silver;\n}\n~~~\n\nCSS colour names are case-insensitive, so you can type silver, Silver, or SILVER and all of them will work. But you must spell the word colour in the american way \"color\"\n\n##Specify in red, green and blue values.\n\nIf you want to specify an orange colour which consists of 80% red, 40% green and 0% blue:\n\n~~~css\nbody {\n  background-color: rgb(80%, 40%, 0%);\n}\n~~~\n\nor you can specify it as numeric values between 0 and 255. So 80% of 255 is 204, 40% of 255 is 102, and 0% of 255 is 0.\n\n~~~css\nbody {\n  background-color: rgb(204, 102, 0);\n}\n~~~\n\n##Specify colour using hex codes.\n\nEach set of two digits of a hex code represents the red, green and blue of the colour. The first two represent red, the second two green and the last two blue.\n\n~~~css \nbody {\n  background-color:  #cc6600;\n}\n~~~\n\nTry out these colours on the web site. \n"},{"title":"#Fonts","shortTitle":"04","contentMd":"#Fonts\n\n###Font families\n\nThe font-family CSS property specifies a prioritized list of one or more font family names and/or generic family names for the selected element.\n\n- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family>\n\nFonts are not consistently available from one computer to another. The available fonts depends on the operating system as well as the fonts and applications that a user has installed. Here's a an example of how to use font-family:\n\n~~~css\nbody {\n  font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n}\n~~~\n\nThe font-family property provides you with a list of preferred fonts. The idea is that most browsers will have your first choice, in this case Verdana, but if none of the specific fonts can be found then the browser uses its default \"sans-serif\" font. Always put a generic font family name at the end, like \"serif\" or \"sans-serif\". Experiment with these in the your style sheet.\n\n##Font Weight\n\nThe font weight property allows you to control how bold the text looks. Bold text looks darker than normal text and tends to be a bit fatter too. You can make any element use bold text by setting the font-weight property to bold.\n\n~~~css\np {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n~~~\n\n##Font sizes\n\nOften the default sizes for headings are a bit large to change these defaults, we have four general techniques:\n\n##1. Specifying using pixels.\n\nYou can specify a font size in pixels. When you specify font size in pixels, you are telling the browser how many pixels tall the letters should be.\n\n~~~css\nbody {\nfont-size: 14px;\n}\n~~~\n\nThe px must come directly after the number, there cannot be a space between them.\n\n![](./img/01.png)\n\n\n##2. Specifying using percentage.\n\nUnlike pixels, which tell the font exactly how big it should be in pixels, a font size specified as a percentage tells the font how big it should be relative to another font size.\n\n~~~css\nh1 {\n  font-size: 150%;\n}\n~~~\n\nThis says that the font size should be 150% of another font size. Font-size is a property that is inherited from the parent element, when you specify a % font size it is relative to the parent element. `<h1>` inherits from body so `<h1>` headings will be 150% of 14px.\n\n![](./img/02.png)\n\n##3. Specifying using \"em\".\n\nThis like percentage is another unit of measure. With em you don't specify a percentage, instead you specify a scaling factor.\n\n~~~css\nh2 {\n  font-size: 1.2em;\n}\n~~~\n\nIf you use this to specify a `<h2>` heading your `<h2>` headings will be 1.2 times the font size of the parent element, which in this case is 1.2 times 14px, which is about 17px.\n\n![](./img/03.png)\n\n##4. Specifying using keywords.\n\nYou can specify a font size as xx-small, x-small,small,medium, large, x-large, or xx-large and the browser will translate these keywords into pixel values using defaults that are set in the browser.\n\n~~~css\nbody {\n  font-size: small;\n}\n~~~\n\n![](./img/04.png)\n\n![](./img/05.png)\n\n## Font Rules\n\nSuppose we wanted to have the following font characteristics - \n\n~~~css\nbody {\n  font-size: small;\n}\n\nh1 {\n  font-size: 150%;\n}\n\nh2 {\n  font-size: 130%;\n}\n~~~\n\nWe can append the above to our existing style sheet, so the complete file looks like this:\n\n~~~\nbody {\n  font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n}\n\nh1, h2 {\n  color: gray\n}\n\nh1 {\n  border-bottom: 1px solid black;\n}\n\nem {\n  color:red;\n}\n\nbody {\n  font-size: small;\n}\n\nh1 {\n  font-size: 150%;\n}\n\nh2 {\n  font-size: 130%;\n}\n~~~\n\nReload the page to make sure it is in effect. Looking again at the stylesheet, compare it with this version:\n\n~~~\nbody {\n  font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n  font-size: small;\n}\n\nh1, h2 {\n  color: gray;\n}\n\nh1 {\n  border-bottom: 1px solid black;\n  font-size: 150%;\n}\n\nem {\n  color: red;\n}\n\nh2 {\n  font-size: 130%;\n}\n~~~\n\nCan you see the difference? There will be no change in how the page appears - however, the second version of the style sheet is expressed more concisely - we have merged some of the rules as appropriate.\n\n\n"},{"title":"#Font, Colour & Line Height","shortTitle":"05","contentMd":"#Font, Colour & Line Height\n\nIn your current style.css, change your CSS file so it now contains the following:\n\n~~~css\nbody {\n  font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n  font-size: small;\n}\n\nh1, h2 {\n  color: #007e7e;\n  border-bottom: 1px solid black;\n}\n\nh1 {\n  font-size: 150%;\n}\n\nh2 {\n  font-size: 130%;\n}\n\np {\n  color: maroon;\n}\n~~~\n\nThe default font family is sans-serif, this is last in the list, the others are alternatives. Save the file and load the home web page in your browser. The headings should now be in sans-serif and an aquamarine colour. The paragraph text is also sans-serif as all elements inherit the `<body>`s font-family property.\n\nWe now want to adjust the line height of the text on the entire page so that there's more vertical space between each line. To do that we add a line-height property in the existing body rule.\n\n~~~css\nbody\n{\n  /* as before */\n  line-height: 1.6em;\n}\n~~~\n\nThis property allows us to specify the line height between each line. Like other font-related properties, you can specify the height in pixels, or using an em or percentage value that's relative to the font size. Save your CSS file and reload your web pages to see the change.\n\nTry a few different line heights like 200%, .5em, and 20px to see the effect. Change the height back to 1.6em when you are finished.\n\nLeave the style sheet looking like this:\n\n~~~\nbody {\n  font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n  font-size: small;\n  line-height: 1.6em;\n}\n\nh1, h2 {\n  color: #007e7e;\n  border-bottom: 1px solid black;\n}\n\nh1 {\n  font-size: 150%;\n}\n\nh2 {\n  font-size: 130%;\n}\n\np {\n  color: maroon;\n}\n~~~"},{"title":"# Relative Paths I","shortTitle":"06","contentMd":"# Relative Paths I\n\nCreate a new folder called deals, in that folder create a new page name it deals.html.\n\n![](img/20x.png)\n\nPut the following code into the page and save.\n\n~~~\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>App Bundle Deals</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\">\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Weekly Deals</h1>\n    <h2>Business Bundle</h2>\n    <p>\n      <img src=\"images/business.png\" alt=\"Business Bundle\"> Here comes the\n      next bundle for march.

We prefer to use 2 spaces for each 'level'.\n\n###Example Inconsistent indentation:\n\n~~~html\n   <html>\n  <head>\n    <title>APP Store</title> <link type=\"text/css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\" media=\"screen\" />  </head>\n  <body>\n    <img src=\"images/score.png\"/><h1>Score: Apps, Movies, Music, Books\n    </h1><ol> <li><a href=\"apps.html\">Apps</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"music.html\">Music</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"movies.html\">Movies</a></li>    </ol>\n    <h2>New Games</h2>\n    <ul>      <li><img src=\"images/delete.png\"/>Clear All</li>\n      <li><img src=\"images/google.jpg\"/>Google Box</li>\n      <li><img src=\"images/squink.jpg\"/>Squinks</li>    </ul>\n     </body>\n</html>\n~~~\n\n###Example Correct indentation\n\n~~~html\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>APP Store</title>\n    <link type=\"text/css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\" media=\"screen\" />\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <img src=\"images/score.png\"/><h1>Score: Apps, Movies, Music, Books</h1>\n    <ol>\n      <li><a href=\"apps.html\">Apps</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"music.html\">Music</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"movies.html\">Movies</a></li>\n    </ol>\n    <h2>New Games</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li><img src=\"images/delete.png\"/>Clear All</li>\n      <li><img src=\"images/google.jpg\"/>Google Box</li>\n      <li><img src=\"images/squink.jpg\"/>Squinks</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n~~~\n\nReview your index.html file and ensure that it is correctly indented. One quick way to determine this is to 'fold' all the elements in the editor. To do this, hover the mouse beside the numbers listed in the left hand margin, downward arrows will appear. By clicking on the arrows the code will expand and collapse.\n\n![](./img/26x.png)\n\nThis will change your editing view something like this:\n\n![](./img/27x.png)\n\nTake the opportunity now to line up all elements consistently.
