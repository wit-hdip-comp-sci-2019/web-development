    "contentMd" : "# Sharing Partials\n\nHave a look at this version of the site:\n\n- <https://wit-hdip-comp-sci-2019.github.io/bundle-store-ejs/www/index.html>\n\nIn particular, notice how the 'Weekly Deals' is present in all three pages.\n\nIf we were not using partials, then we would have had to copy/paste this section into each page. With the template infrastructure in place, this becomes a trivial change:\n\n## apps.html\n\n~~~\n<div id=\"navigation\">\n  <ul id=\"menu\">\n    <li><a href=\"index.html\">Home</a></li>\n    <li class=\"active\"><a href=\"apps.html\">Apps</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"directions.html\">Directions</a></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<div id=\"maincontent\">\n  <div id=\"primary\">\n    <h1>App Bundles</h1>\n    <h3>Freebie</h3>\n    <p>\n      <img src=\"images/ondesoft.jpg\" alt=\"One Soft\" class=\"medium-right-img\"> Stacksocial just published its so called\n      Free Ondesoft Mac Tool Bundle, which contains 5 apps from Onesoft. The bundle is worth $146 will be probably\n      available only a couple of days so you’d better hurry up to get it. </p>\n    <hr>\n    <h3>Macware Business Bundle</h3>\n    <p>\n      Here comes the next bundle for march. This time its macware who publish a bundle. The so called macware Business\n      Bundle contains 6 apps at a price of only €29.99 instead of €199.94. So you can save around 84%. </p>\n    <hr>\n    <h3>Ultimate Bundle</h3>\n    <p>\n      <img src=\"images/ultimate.jpeg\" alt=\"One Soft\" class=\"medium-left-img\"> This bundle is worth more than €400. So\n      for just a little bit more than $10, you can make your bargain if you want just one of these apps. of dollars. We\n      think, that the bundle will be online until the mid of October </p>\n    <hr>\n  </div>\n  <%- include('./partials/_secondary.ejs'); %>\n</div>\n~~~\n\n## directions.html\n\n~~~\n<div id=\"navigation\">\n  <ul id=\"menu\">\n    <li><a href=\"index.html\">Home</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"apps.html\">Apps</a></li>\n    <li class=\"active\"><a href=\"directions.html\">Directions</a></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<div id=\"maincontent\">\n  <div id=\"primary\">\n    <h1>Directions</h1>\n    <h2>Our store is located :</h2>\n    <p>\n      Take the M9 / N9 towards Waterford. At the first roundabout on approach to Waterford, take the first exit\n      (signposted Waterford / Cork / Rosslare). At the next roundabout, take the third exit (signposted N25 / Cork /\n      Waterford South). Proceed through the toll bridge (toll is €1.90 per car). Take the exit directly after the toll\n      bridge (signposted Waterford South/R710). </p>\n    <p>\n      At the top of the off-ramp, go left at the small roundabout, then straight through two larger roundabouts\n      (signposted R710/City Centre/Tramore). At the next roundabout ( retail park on your left), take the first exit\n      (signposted City Centre). Proceed down the Cork Road for approx 2km and the main entrance to WIT’s main campus is\n      on the left. The College Street Campus is a further 2km towards the city centre on the left. </p>\n    <hr>\n  </div>\n  <%- include('./partials/_secondary.ejs'); %>\n</div>\n~~~\n\nMake these change now, and verify your site looks the same a this:\n\n- <https://wit-hdip-comp-sci-2019.github.io/bundle-store-ejs/www/index.html>\n"
